Turning Winds 
Turning Winds is a specialized Residential Treatment Center and Therapeutic Boarding School for troubled teens, ages 13 to 18. 
Enrollment of up to approximately 45 students; program length averages 12 months
Provides therapeutic intervention for issues such as low self-worth, critical behavioral problems, and poor academic performance. 
More specifically, Turning Winds provides treatment for ADD, ADHD, depression, anxiety, addictions, substance abuse, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, spectrum disorders, adjustment disorders, bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, anorexia, bulimia, and attachment disorders.
5 Pillars of Therapeutic Change:
Character Education and Life Skills
Teens increase personal understanding by taking accountability for personal actions, planning and working toward personal goals, and recognizing personal successes.
Health, Wellness, and Fitness
Through the use of a nutritionist and our medical staff, our students receive a healthy diet based on their individual needs. 
Students engage routinely in team sports, individualized fitness programs, and outdoor experiential education as part of our school curriculum. 
Outdoor Education
Turning Winds uses the outdoors to combine adventure therapy, experiential education, and psycho-educational therapy. 
Therapeutic Success
Licensed professional clinicians assess each teen and participate with the student and her or his family to identify problem areas and then to develop individualized goals and objectives designed to guide the change and personal growth process.
Also, use group therapy to address and facilitate addiction and recovery groups for those teens who may have substance abuse issues. 
Academic Achievement
Highly trained, board-certified teachers assess the academic needs of each teen during the admission process, taking into account previous transcripts, learning disabilities, strengths, interests, and any specific needs or accommodations as outlined in a student’s Individual Education Plan (IEP), when present.

Crossroads Academy  
Crossroads serves adolescent boys 14-18 years old in a home environment. 
Specialize in treating substance abuse and the underlying issues that play into that abuse (i.e. depression, learning difficulties, anxiety, low self-esteem, and ODD). 
They have created a unique environment that emphasizes autonomy and purposeful living. This environment is driven by a relationship-based model that celebrates diversity and individualization.
Types of therapy
Individual
One hour per week with his therapist with small caseloads
Typical weekly individual sessions will be spent outside of our offices going for walks, taking drives up the beautiful canyons, going to lunch, fishing, sitting on top of the skate ramp, and in many other locations.
Group
In group therapy, each boy will have opportunities to share his stories and experiences with peers who can often relate to the things he has been going through and who are able to offer him acceptance and support. 
Family
Families will receive weekly family therapy sessions over the phone and sessions in person, whenever the parents come out for a visit.
Parents will have reading assignments and participate in family, couple, or group therapy at home as needed. We encourage Al-Anon meetings, as they can be a helpful resource for families.
Recovery
In addition to the substance abuse work being done in individual, family, and group therapy, your son will also receive three hours each week of chemical dependency (CD) work with our substance abuse counselors.
Academics
Each student who enters our program will have a college/career readiness plan that will address his current needs and skills. This plan will first address his current educational status, including possible areas of concern. If necessary, your son will be placed on an accelerated program to help him catch up on missed credits and put him back on the road to graduation.

This includes: 
A Co-ed milieu that allows students to practice healthy boundaries and relationships with the opposite sex
Opportunities for jobs in the community and to be off-campus in unsupervised capacities as students

Menninger Clinic 
The team seeks a broad understanding of your child through a battery of diagnostics, including psychological and neuropsychological testing, brain imaging, genetic testing and other laboratory measures, if necessary. Specialized, on-site consultation addresses substance use and addictions, trauma, anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attentional problems (ADHD), autism (ASD), eating disorders, attachment disorders and more.
 While the average length of stay is around three to four weeks, some patients remain an inpatient for continuing treatment.
 CPAS (Comprehensive Psychiatric Assessment Service) offers customized, intensive and therapeutic diagnostic evaluations. An assessment can help clarify your underlying issues and determine what the most effective treatment would be. 
The assessment’s findings can then help your future clinicians create an effective, personalized treatment plan, which starts during your assessment, to get you back on track as efficiently and effectively as possible. 
The assessment may include:
Psychiatric evaluation.
Genetic testing, as indicated.
Neuropsychological screening, as indicated.
MRI and other imaging tests.
Psychological testing.
Psychosocial evaluation.
Family system evaluation.
Additional tests, such as PET scans and sleep studies.
Routine laboratory tests and specialized tests, if indicated.
Urine toxicology screens.
Specialty consultation, as indicated.
Academics
They appreciate the importance of school and want to ensure that your adolescent has the chance to achieve academic success while an inpatient and after discharge. That’s why Menninger offers a certified private school teacher who works with their adolescent patients, their parents, and their schools to develop individualized plans for completing academic work during their hospitalization. 
Two hours every weekday morning are devoted to academics.

Huntsman Mental Health Institute 
What is the Comprehensive Assessment and Treatment (CAT) Youth Program?
The CAT Program for youth ages 4-17 at the Huntsman Mental Health Institute is a clinical program designed to help gain an understanding of a youth’s mental health and behavioral issues. It is designed as a four to six-week program with a multidisciplinary team that works closely together to evaluate the youth, accurately identify their diagnoses, and actively begin treatment. 
We have expertise including, but not limited to, the following problems:
Mood disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder),
Anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder, OCD,),
Psychosis and thought disorders (e.g., schizophrenia),
Autism spectrum disorders,
Trauma-related issues (e.g., PTSD),
Personality and identity development challenges
Substance abuse
Our strong psychiatric presence and multi-disciplinary approach help us stand out from other programs. Unlike many other assessment programs, our CAT Program’s psychiatric providers are child and adolescent psychiatrists who meet with the child and communicate with the treatment team at least six days per week. As a free-standing psychiatric hospital, we are also equipped to provide a higher level of safety and supervision than other assessment programs. Our 24-hour nursing care helps us closely monitor medication changes and effects, and provide care for youth with some chronic medical conditions that cannot be safely cared for at other assessment programs. 
What is the environment and peer group like in the CAT Program?
Adolescents between 13–17 years old receive treatment in our adolescent inpatient CAT unit. Children between the ages of 4–12 receive treatment in our child inpatient unit. The youth that make up our program seek out treatment for a variety of mental health issues. The make-up of our social environment is an important element in our program, and it is a consideration in our admission review process. Every parent is concerned about what type of environment their child will be in, and we are confident that our social environment and individualized treatment program provides a very healing therapeutic atmosphere.

WHAT WE TREAT
Mission Prep aims to provide support and sustainable change for adolescents and families who are challenged by primary mental health struggles. We firmly believe in treating the entire family system and allowing families to address the challenges of their children in a safe, sustainable way. At Mission Prep we are committed to preparing teens for the challenges of life and giving families the fresh start they need at our teen mental health treatment.
To do this we utilize a blend of time-tested therapeutic approaches as well as innovative interventions.
We create a sustainable experience that can be built upon long after the youth discharges from Mission Prep. Every element of the family’s care is conducted with attention and purpose from the sessions with our board-certified psychiatrist to the beautiful, home-like environment cultivated to bring a sense of belonging and connection for those in our care.
OUR APPROACH
At Mission Prep, we strive to provide a unique and innovative therapeutic approach that blends time-tested therapeutic approaches with innovative interventions.
COLLABORATIVE CARE
We invite clients and families into active conversation and collaboration to help determine the appropriate care plan. We strive to create open dialogue with clients and families.
VOTE & VOICE
Clients have a vote and voice in their treatment. This creates responsibility, agency and self-efficacy that can be translated into their daily lives during and post treatment.
SUSTAINABILITY
Rather than removing all stressors, we allow for selective exposure which allows the care team to step in to help if necessary while allowing the client the opportunity to learn how to positively handle potential triggers.
FAMILY FOCUSED
Successful treatment starts with working with the entire family system. We treat families with the same attention and care as we do their loved ones staying with us. We provide them with support and resources to utilize regularly.

 The Lakeside Academy faculty to student ratio is typically 1:10, which means customized instruction and lots of attention to facilitate a successful academic experience.

We provide holistic drug rehabilitation for students diagnosed with substance use disorder as well as assistance with behavioral health issues as needed. We accept teen boys who have a history of self-harm, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, and unmanaged anger.
When your son enrolls, he will begin with drug and alcohol detoxification and 30 to 60 days of clinical chemical dependency treatment as needed. Students receive mental health counseling and learn strategies to advocate for their best interests, communicate with others effectively, redirect risky behaviors, and develop better self-control.
Our counselors, faculty, and staff instill the values of character, discipline, and faith while offering the physical, emotional, and spiritual support your child needs to thrive. With a point-scoring system, students become able to connect their behavior with the consequences, whether positive or negative.
What to expect
 Admission starts with a comprehensive evaluation of your son's needs so that we can enroll him in the right programs. First, families fill out an application and submit supplemental paperwork as needed. We can also provide information about insurance coverage for substance use treatment and mental health counseling with professional Lakeside Academy staff.

Green Hill Recovery 
  Green Hill transitional living program provides structure and support as residents build the foundations of their recovery and shift into ‘real-life.’ They believe that having fun is essential to the recovery process and provide ample opportunities for young men to explore their passions. However, it is not a summer camp. Their program focuses on finding a healthy balance between fun and personal growth.
Green Hill provides its residents with structure and coaching as they return to school, work, and dating. The Green Hill team knows that early recovery is full of challenges and opportunities. We believe that building a well-rounded, values-focused individual is critical to achieving lasting recovery.
Transitional Living program overview
 Phase 1: Ground
Recovery at Green Hill begins with a deep connection to the community and understanding of the recovery process. Residents take a look at their past, come to terms with their substance use, and begin defining what an abundant life in recovery entails.
  Phase 2: Discover
We support residents in discovering their values, goals, and motivations. Residents work alongside the Green Hill team to begin implementing a step-by-step plan that addresses self-care, academic and/or career, and life goals.
Phase 3: Empower
We empower our residents to take initiative in their lives and provide mentorship and leadership in the Green Hill community. Clients actualize their academic or career plans, fostering self-efficacy and mutual responsibility.
 Phase 4: Connect
We encourage residents to connect to their peers, family, and the wider Raleigh community, developing a sustainable path toward long-term recovery. Residents maintain stability and generate their accountability resources.
The Green Hill clinical team takes a holistic, clinically informed approach to therapy that leans heavily on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), trauma-informed therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions to meet the individual needs of our residents. 
The therapeutic experience at Green Hill helps our residents to discover their values and goals, empowers them to build self-efficacy, and connects them to an integrated way of life.
 Dually licensed clinicians for substance use and mental health
Residents receive up to fifteen hours of clinical care weekly

Telos Academy
Services are offered for teen boys under 18 years of age. 
These teens are often dealing with depression, anxiety, social problems, executive function needs, and learning differences.
Staff uses proven clinical therapies coupled with the power of healing relationships to promote deep, lasting change. Their aim is to help students live principle-based lives characterized by insightful choices.  Through their specialized services, students find clarity, healing, and direction.
Culture:
Telos's loving and engaged culture includes the “arm around the shoulder” attitude toward growth and healing. Telos Academy is a clinically sophisticated, relationship-based treatment center for teen boys. Youthfulness brings energy and enthusiasm, which includes noise, laughter, and sometimes even tears. For 15 years Telos has walked side-by-side with these teen boys and have seen over 900 families complete the process with incredible outcomes and life-changing opportunities for both the student and the family. Success.
Individualized Attention:
Class sizes are kept small (6-9 students). This enables their teachers to attend to students individually.
Most classes also include a teacher’s aide. In these classes, students enjoy a staff-to-student ratio of 1:4.
Telos Team:
Telos has 4 teams of 12 students. Each team has 3 staff (mentors) in addition to their teachers, therapists, medical personnel, and other support staff. This small team size and true 1:4 staff ratio prevent students from “flying under the radar”.
In addition to small teams and high staff ratios, each student selects one mentor that serves as a personal Principles Coach throughout his stay.  This staff works very closely with the student and his therapist, and may occasionally participate in individual therapy sessions. The Principles Coach is there to assist the boy with specific needs and serves as a source of support and encouragement.
Academic Excellence:
All teachers are licensed and credentialed in their content areas. This means the teachers have a depth of knowledge that surpasses the “generalist” teachers who teach all subjects.
Students are assisted in researching appropriate colleges. They are mentored through the application process from start to finish.
Telos Academy offers 12-week SAT/ACT preparation course taught by licensed, credentialed teachers.

Sustain Recovery 
Residential Treatment
Sustain Recovery is a treatment facility founded upon evidence-based clinical treatment modalities and best practice principles. We utilize a multifaceted process, integrating a balance of clinical interventions, 12 Step recovery and holistic modalities that provides adolescents a positive and loving environment where they can address their addiction and mental health needs. Our goal is to facilitate education, interpersonal awareness and behavioral change through continuity and proven recovery / mental health skill development or enhancement that supports learning and change.
Comprehensive Approach to Treatment
Within 24 hours upon admission, each adolescent is seen by the medical doctor and psychiatrist to determine medical and mental health needs. A qualified addiction and mental health specialist completes a comprehensive bio/social assessment from which an Individual Treatment Pan is developed based on information from referral documentation, the adolescent, family, medical doctor, psychiatrist, and bio/social assessment. This information is used to identify areas in need of support and treatment goals to address mental health and recovery needs. Work towards meeting goals is completed through individual and group sessions with progress monitored and documented daily.
At Sustain Recovery, we have observed repeated cases in which the drastic change from short-term intensive inpatient treatment to unstructured sober living or immediately returning back home has resulted in relapse. 
This is especially true for adolescents with co-occurring disorders, due to the difficult process of adjusting to the home environment without the use of drugs or alcohol, staying away from negative influences, and the lack of internal structure. As we see it, the structure that was imposed on the individual in addiction treatment (the clinical schedule), cannot be sustained without ongoing attention to structure. We know that when a resident comes into an Extended Care Treatment environment, which initially provides the same degree of structure as treatment, the necessary healthy living skills can be (re)introduced and utilized in “real time”, in the real world, with the support and safety net of the Sustain Recovery staff and community.
Many times the adolescents going through this experience have dropped out of school, have legal issues secondary to their substance use, and are without a safe and sober environment to live. The need for a more structured Extended Care geared towards adolescents that focuses on adult living skills, education, involvement in Twelve Step organizations and fun in recovery, is what is at the core of Sustain Recovery. As our residents are introduced to the opportunities to do worthwhile and esteem-able tasks, they develop self-worth and self-esteem.

 Momentum Recovery 
•   Young men ages 18 to 30 can break the cycle of addiction and chart a new course at The Creek by Momentum Recovery. By building meaningful relationships and experiencing the power of a healthy support network, Momentum community members learn how to live a passionate and purposeful life — in recovery.
•   Momentum Recovery focuses on treating every client holistically: identifying and healing the underlying trauma and diagnosing and treating any mental health issues. Using a customized mix of therapies, education, and experiential activities, our clinical team helps each community member feel equipped for life free from drugs and alcohol.
•   Momentum community members take advantage of our custom four-phase long-term treatment approach. Throughout each phase on the continuum of care, young men will receive personalized case management, immersion in the local recovery community, family programming, adventure-based therapy, educational support, financial skills development, vocational support, nutritional support, and opportunities for recreation.
•   Phase 1 Dock (Primary Addiction Treatment)
•   During Phase One, community members begin to lay the foundation of a purposeful and sober life. Living in our comfortable residential addiction treatment housing, members of our Dock program take a step away from their lives and focus on themselves and their new community. During the Dock phase, you or your loved one will spend the majority of the day in dual-diagnosis group therapy, individual therapy, family therapy, or adventure-based therapy activities. Guided by our caring and expert clinicians, our community members begin to uncover and work through the issues contributing toward their addiction.
•   Phase 2 Anchor (Extended Care)
•   Our Anchor program is similar to an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP). Here, young men spend half of their day focusing on addiction treatment that includes the same group sessions or activities as they did in our Dock program. However, they are given more autonomy outside of treatment hours to practice their new life skills and coping mechanisms as they begin to explore life in recovery. 
•   Phase 3 Harbor (Sober Living)
•   While completing the Anchor program, our male clients reside in a spacious sober living home in the Wilmington, NC, area. Our property offers private bedrooms and bathrooms, but also features ample community space where the men can continue to build long-lasting, healthy relationships in recovery. Community members can drink their morning coffee while looking out over the large creek nearby, fish, or kayak with their new friends.
•   Phase 4 Compass (Change Management)
•   As our male clients transition to the final phase of care, they begin to venture out on their own — with our support every step of the way. This means living in housing of their choice while continuing to work individually with their therapist and case manager. In Compass, we require our clients to stay involved in the recovery community and encourage them to continue to participate in the experiential activities all levels of care receive to continue growing their support systems and passion for a sober life. The Compass phase includes regular drug testing and other structures to help clients maintain accountability and focus in the critical phase of early recovery.

 Surfside Recovery Services 18 & OLDER STRICT
Our Mission
Surfside’s long term extended care disrupts the cycle of addiction and mental illness. Our men’s recovery program offers an extensive and unique wraparound support system that assists men in the transition from addiction treatment to a sustainable, enjoyable life in recovery. Rooted in the 12 steps, we use an array of tools and activities to help these men rebuild, rediscover and recover.
Our Objective
Surfside will teach our residents life-changing principles of honesty, accountability and action. We use measurable goals in our life development program, extensive 12-step immersion, clinical support and an array of action sports and adventure-based activities.
Clinical Services
Surfside’s extended care offers comprehensive support through our sober living and life development program. Surfside utilizes community partners to offer wraparound clinical and medical services, creating a fully integrated approach to addiction treatment.
We found this adds a level of clinical support that residents, families, and referring agencies appreciate while still providing ample time for our residents to build life skills, engage in meaningful activities and begin to enjoy life beyond the walls of an addiction treatment center.
We also feel comfortable partnering with other local treatment providers for this level of care if it’s a better fit. Our staff completes a thorough pre-admission and admissions assessment, which allows us to build out a comprehensive plan for each resident.
Our Program
Surfside Extended Care utilizes an action driven phase program. This phased program is broken into 3 parts that have measurable goals to be completed by the resident before he can move into the next phase.
Phase 1 -Rebuild

Calos Program
Calo Programs uses the Commitment, Acceptance, Secure, Attunement (CASA) Treatment Model to establish acceptance and security. Through the commitment and acceptance of caregivers, students receiving residential treatment can feel secure and attune, beginning to form healthy and safe relationships.
Implementing a relational treatment model, Calo uses evidence-based attachment research combined with the science of neurobiology to create real change. Their proprietary treatment approach is comprehensive and holistic, helping students find co-regulation and joy.
What to Expect
Students enrolled in our residential treatment center participate in weekly family and individual therapy, although at times, a crisis may change the frequency of the therapy. Calo Programs rely on family support and encourage family members to visit every 4-8 weeks. Each student is also encouraged to call his or her family weekly. Additionally, Calo hosts 4 annual parent events to give families an opportunity to connect with others who are on the same journey while engaging therapeutically with their child and therapists. The average stay for students is 12-15 months as they prioritize emotional, mental, behavioral, and physical health.
Calo primarily helps students impacted by trauma such as from adoptions (or more accurately relinquishment from birth parents), chronic stress, disruptions in early childhood, and inconsistent care from caregivers. 
Most students at our residential treatment facility have struggled to be in a healthy relationship with their family and/or peers, often experience emotional dysregulation, and have difficulty maintaining safe behavior at home or in school. Students come to Calo Programs struggling with adoption issues, identity issues, reactive attachment disorder, and/or personality disorders.

Foundation House: 
Our program is built to meet a cross-section of BEHAVIORAL, EMOTIONAL and MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. We SPECIALIZE IN RELAPSE PREVENTION while following the basic principles of a 12 STEP PROGRAM. 
Most of our clients have first attended a therapeutic wilderness program, primary treatment program or therapeutic boarding school. We offer the structure and accountability stressed in those programs, while teaching residents how to live and think independently. 
Our typical length of stay varies from six months to one year, depending on a resident’s needs. During that time, we guide clients through the process of building a foundation for recovery, setting goals for the future, and preparing for a life of sober independence. Foundation House programming is designed to provide residents with a diverse platform of experiences and new habits that reinforce a fun and dignified life in sobriety. 
Our program incorporates a fully licensed Intensive Outpatient Program. Clients receive a minimum of nine clinical hours each week through various groups, weekly individual therapy and 12 Step studies. 
Our long list of offerings also includes gym memberships, yoga, cooking classes, holistic health lessons, a float spa, woodworking, travel, volunteer programs and sports leagues. We keep our residents busy but surround their structured time with freedom and autonomy that allows them to feel uniquely trusted and an active part of their recovery process. 
Personalized treatment for older adolescents (16- 19), young adults (20-27), and adult (28+) males. 
Foundation House starts with our PHP, following client stabilization and detox. We focus on individual needs in a structured environment, minimizing distractions and enhancing stability. Our comprehensive approach includes addiction and mental health education, robust support services, and family integration. Clients receive 20+ hours of clinical care weekly, including therapy, experiential activities, and medical oversight for personalized, evidence-based recovery.  
STAGE ONE PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAM (PHP) Progressing to Stage Two, our IOP promotes increased independence while maintaining clinical and behavioral support.

Voyage Recovery Center: (18+)
The Voyage model of treatment begins after the patient completes stabilization at detox. Once he is released to us, we spend the first period of treatment focused on the individual. Each person has their own challenges and needs, however our structure remains consistent. Addiction creates a cycle of chaos and impulsivity so these weeks realign the patient’s sense of stability and routine, creating a safe environment for recovery. Patients are educated about addiction and mental health issues, and we integrate their family into this process.  
Patients attend at least 30 hours of clinical care weekly, which includes multiple daily groups, individual therapy, and experiential work. The men are free from distractions such as cell phones, computers (beyond any academic or vocational necessities), and any responsibilities or obligations beyond their wellness.  
Each patient participates in weekly staff-facilitated experiential activities outside the House that incorporate mind and body, service and fun, and plenty of clinical involvement. These experiences could include helping underprivileged people in Martin County, catching Mahi-Mahi offshore, camping in a State Park, or a local kayak excursion.  
Voyage Recovery Center treats patients who have a primary diagnosis of substance use disorder, and a co-occuring or comorbid or dual diagnosis of a mental health disorder. 
When treating young men with a dual diagnosis, the Voyage psychiatric team collaborates with a patient’s physician and case history to ensure effective tandem treatment.  
Treatment planning is tailored to each patient to accommodate variations in patient needs, such as when there is a co-occurring mental health disorder. Our therapeutic approach is to treat the whole patient, addressing the entirety of a man’s symptoms at once. The clinical team creates a treatment plan tailored to the individual, and employs a range of evidence-based modalities appropriate for his unique set of symptoms. 
The second period of treatment maintains momentum with daily groups, individual work and experiential offerings, but widens the lens from self to self-within-the-family. Addiction hurts everyone in the family, and recovery will require the patient to be accountable for their past and future role in that family. We ask the same of the families through their attendance of an intensive Family Program. While the patient works on himself, Voyage counselors work with the family to prepare them for the healing challenge of that program. 
Beyond the Family Program, weekly updates, family conferences, and clinical assignments are hallmarks of the commitment to this piece of our patient’s recovery. 
The final stage of treatment at Voyage honors the importance of relationships and environment as the patient prepares for a life beyond treatment. Continuing care, or aftercare, is a necessary, evidence-based component of treatment. It’s crucial that we come together—patient, family and Voyage clinical staff—to create a plan that puts young men in the sweet spot for lifelong remission. Academic and vocational progress does not need to be halted for recovery to happen, in fact a planned immersion back into those worlds with support will bolster recovery outcomes. Whatever balance works best for the patient and their family, no solution is too creative. We know that if this piece is not agreed upon and investigated before discharge there is almost no chance it will happen. 
Our goal as treatment providers is provide these young men and their family the opportunity to create a vision for a healthy, happy and productive future free from substance abuse.

Galen Hope 
What we do
Galen Hope offers four tiers of treatment, including two partial hospitalization (PHP) with community integration options and two intensive outpatient (IOP) with community integration options for adults and teens struggling with a range of mental health disorders. Some of our clients are entering treatment for the first time, while others are stepping down from inpatient or residential treatment and want to be sure that they are taking the next steps with intention.
The intimate size of our treatment program enables us to customize treatment for each individual. We recognize that not everyone’s symptoms or experiences will neatly fit into set diagnostic categories, and many people are dealing with more than one issue.
Neurodiverse
At Galen Hope, we embrace and affirm neurodiversity and welcome clients who are autistic, have ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, or other diagnoses that fall under the neurodivergent umbrella. We do not label neurodiversity as disordered but rather view it as a piece of the larger clinical picture. We strive to make the necessary accommodations to help our neurodivergent clients with eating disorders and mental health diagnoses access treatment in the ways that best suit their needs and unique ways of seeing the world.
At Galen Hope, we achieve this via a socially inclusive environment, adaptations to manualized treatments that were initially designed for neurotypical individuals, a strengths and interests-based approach, work with families, independent-living support, community integration, and space and time in the day for sensory needs to be accommodated – including a sensory room! The intimate and flexible nature of Galen Hope’s therapeutic community enables us to tailor treatment to best suit our client’s needs and help to heal the treatment trauma that may have previously occurred in other settings.
